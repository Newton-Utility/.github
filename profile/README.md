## About Newton
Newton (formerly known as CloudMagic) is a premium, subscription-based email client designed for professionals and power users who want more control and insight from their email. It focuses on providing a set of "superpowers" that go beyond basic email management, transforming your inbox into a proactive productivity hub. By unifying all your email accounts (Gmail, iCloud, Outlook, Yahoo, IMAP) into a single, clean interface, Newton eliminates the need to switch between tabs or apps. Its hallmark features—like knowing exactly when someone has read your email or being able to schedule a message to arrive first thing in a colleague's morning—are designed to save time and add a layer of intelligence to your communication.

The application stands out for its thoughtful, cross-platform design and unique feature set. It was one of the first mainstream clients to popularize "Read Receipts" for any email account and "Send Later" scheduling. While it offers a beautiful, ad-free experience, its value proposition lies in these advanced tools that cater to business communication, sales follow-ups, and managing a high-volume inbox with intention. For users who rely on email as a critical workflow tool and are willing to invest in a superior experience, Newton delivers a polished, powerful, and connected ecosystem.
